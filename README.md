The dataset includes columns such as "country_name" for the name of the country,"country_code" for the name of the country, "indicator_name" for the name of the debt indicator, "indicator_code" for the code of the indicator, and "debt" for the debt amount.

The dataset contains information on multiple countries and their respective debt levels. It allows for analysis and exploration of different aspects of debt, such as total debt by country, average debt across indicators, highest debt by specific indicators, and more. The dataset enables understanding and comparison of debt situations across countries and provides insights into the magnitude and distribution of debt based on different indicators.

Using SQL queries, various questions can be answered regarding the dataset, such as the total number of countries, the total amount of debt owed, the country with the maximum debt, distinct debt indicators, debt of each country, average debt across indicators, highest principal repayments, common debt indicators, the country with the lowest debt, and more. These queries provide valuable insights into the debt landscape captured by the dataset, aiding in analysis and decision-making related to international debt.
